# Machine Learning on Crypto Currency market data

This repo hold market data retrieved from poloniex, that I applied various Machine Learning Models to.

Combine Data - is used to merge all the separate CSV files into one large dataframe

Data Integrity - is used to check that there are no gaps in the data

Feature Generation - is used to create more feature using TA-Lib which generate Technical Analysis features

Initial Machine learning - Contains models that were created using Scikit Learn like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification and Decision Tree Classifier

ML Development - Has models that were trained on different features and contains a correlation matrix to determine which features impact next day price

MLP Network - Tensorflow implementation of a multi layered perceptron network

RNN Implementation - Keras implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network

Simple Feedforward NN - Tensorflow implementation of a feed forward neural net
